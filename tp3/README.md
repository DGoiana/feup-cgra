## TP 3 Notes

- Adding materials to each part of the tangram was trivial, we just had to read a bit deeper into the differences between diffuse, ambient and specular.
- The first struggle was with setting up the correspondent indices to prism's vertices, which was what took us the most amount of time.
- Setting up the normals was quite straightforward, the most difficult part was it's mathematical forms.
